Microsoft screwed up. The Secure Boot compliance check does not work on ALL devices. If TPM 1.2 is the most the device will handle it "could" report Secure Boot.

This will not be fixed by MS. They don't care. Here is the Custom compliance solution.

It's not perfect. It works. It can help elimiate the problem. Remove the standard secure boot check and push this custom compliance. It will report back correctly.
